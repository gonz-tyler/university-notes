# Week 1.1: Introduction to Distributed Systems
## Notes
---

### What is a Distributed System?
- A collection of autonomous computers linked by a network, working together to create an integrated computing infrastructure.
- Distributed systems appear as a single system to users but consist of multiple independent nodes.

### Key Concepts
- **Information**: Processed data that is meaningful and useful.
- **Security**: Ensuring unauthorized users cannot access data and services while maintaining availability for authorized users.

### Why Use Distributed Systems?
- **Geographic Distribution**: Natural for systems spread over multiple locations.
- **Resource Sharing**: Efficient use of shared resources (e.g., cloud storage, distributed databases).
- **Scalability**: Adding more nodes to increase computational power.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Redundancy and recovery mechanisms.

### Models of Distributed Systems
1. **Client-Server Model**: Centralized server handling client requests.
2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model**: No central authority, all nodes are equal.
3. **Middleware-based Model**: Middleware abstracts complexity.

### Challenges in Distributed Systems
- **Concurrency**: Coordinating independent executions.
- **Failures**: Nodes or networks may fail unpredictably.
- **Network Delays**: Hard to distinguish congestion from failure.
- **No Global Clock**: Difficult to synchronize operations.
