# Week 08.1: Information Security Management Revision Notes

---

## 1. Information Security Management Overview

* **Objective**: Security management is about protecting an entire organization, not just a single system. It involves orchestrating resources (people, technology, processes) to secure business functions.
* **Top-Down Approach**: Security must be integrated into the larger organizational ecosystem, including:
    * **IT Systems**: Hardware, software, networks.
    * **People**: Users, administrators, partners.
    * **Business Processes**: The core functions of the organization.
    * **External Environment**: Laws, regulations (e.g., GDPR), customers, suppliers, and attackers.
* **Governance**: Top management is responsible for ensuring security risks are managed and that IT investments deliver value. Security must balance **risk** (potential for harm) against **opportunity** (business benefits).

## 2. Core Security Concepts Recap

* **Assets**: Things of value to the organization.
* **Threats**: Potential causes of harm to assets.
* **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses (e.g., software bugs) that can be exploited.
* **Risk**: The potential for harm, often defined as **Risk = Impact × Probability**.
* **Countermeasures (Controls)**: Measures taken to reduce risk.
* **Sensitivity vs. Criticality**:
    * **Sensitivity**: Importance of information confidentiality (needs protection).
    * **Criticality**: Dependence of the organization on the information/system availability (needs uptime).

## 3. The Human Element: Social Engineering

Social engineering is the art of exploiting human psychology to gain unauthorized access, rather than using technical hacking. "Amateurs attack machines; professionals target people."

### Why it Works
* **Human Nature**: People generally want to be helpful, avoid conflict, and trust others.
* **Psychological Triggers**: Attackers use urgency, authority, fear, greed, or curiosity to manipulate victims.
* **Diffusion of Responsibility**: Convincing the victim that someone else is responsible for the action.

### Common Techniques
* **Phishing**: Sending fraudulent emails to trick users into revealing sensitive info.
* **Vishing / Smishing**: Phishing via voice calls or SMS.
* **Pretexting**: Creating a fabricated scenario (e.g., pretending to be IT support) to steal information.
* **Tailgating**: Following an authorized person into a secure area ("Can you hold the door? I forgot my badge").
* **CEO Fraud (Business Email Compromise)**: Impersonating a senior executive to trick an employee into transferring funds.

### famous Example: Kevin Mitnick
A notorious hacker turned security consultant who famously used social engineering to breach major corporations, proving that the human element is often the weakest link in security.

## 4. Computer Ethics and Professionalism

* **Ethics vs. Morals**:
    * **Morals**: Internal, personal beliefs about right and wrong.
    * **Ethics**: External, shared rules of conduct for a specific group or profession.
* **Professionalism**: Computing is a profession with responsibilities. Professional bodies (BCS, ACM, IEEE) have **Codes of Conduct** that members must adhere to.
* **Key Ethical Principles**:
    * Maintain technical competence.
    * Respect the interests of customers/public.
    * Act with integrity and avoid harm.
* **Liability**: Breaching ethical codes can have legal consequences and lead to being "struck off" (losing professional status).

## 5. Security Policies

A **Security Policy** is a formal statement of management's intentions and direction regarding information security. It is a key part of an Information Security Management System (ISMS), often based on ISO 27000 standards.

### Characteristics of Good Policies
* **Clear Purpose**: Explains *why* the policy exists.
* **Scope**: Defines what (and who) is covered.
* **Enforceable**: Must be practical to implement and monitor.
* **Clear Responsibilities**: Who is responsible for what?
* **Language**: Uses precise terms like "shall" (mandatory), "should" (recommended), and "may" (permitted).

### Policy Lifecycle
1.  **Drafting**: Writing the policy.
2.  **Review & Authorization**: Approval by management.
3.  **Distribution**: Communicating it to staff (crucial step!).
4.  **Enforcement**: Monitoring compliance.
5.  **Review & Update**: Keeping it relevant over time.

### Why Policies Fail
* **"Dump and Forget"**: Just posting a policy on the intranet without proper communication or training is ineffective.
* **Too Complex**: If staff can't understand it, they won't follow it.
* **Unrealistic**: Policies that hinder productivity will be bypassed.
