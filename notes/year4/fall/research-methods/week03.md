# Week03: Projects and LaTeX Revision Notes

## 1. Dissertation Projects

Dissertation projects are substantial pieces of work that typically fall into one of three categories.

### Types of Dissertation Projects

1.  **Prototype**:
    -   Develop a new application or system that does something useful, ideally for real-world users.
    -   Requires requirements analysis and evaluation with users.
    -   Example: A tool to give feedback to new mothers based on baby data.

2.  **Improvement**:
    -   Propose and develop a better algorithm or system for a specific task.
    -   Requires an experimental comparison to the current state-of-the-art.
    -   Example: A new technique for more believable body language in a specific game context.

3.  **Exploration**:
    -   Test a computer science hypothesis, often one from a published research paper.
    -   Requires rigorous implementation and experimentation.
    -   Example: Evaluating how much ChatGPT actually helps software developer productivity.

### The Project Process

The typical workflow for a dissertation project is:
1.  **Project Plan**
2.  **Literature Review**
3.  **Develop Algorithm/System**
4.  **Evaluate Algorithm/System**
5.  **Write Dissertation**

A good strategy is to break the project into a **core** component (what you can definitely finish) and **extensions** (extra features or experiments if time permits).

### Thesis Structure

A standard thesis or project report includes:
-   **Introduction**: Context, hypothesis, aims.
-   **Literature Review**: Critical review of existing work.
-   **Method / Experimental Setup**: What you built/ran and why.
-   **Results**: What you found, with statistical analysis.
-   **Discussion**: Critical analysis of your findings.
-   **Conclusion**: Summary, lessons learned, and future work.

## 2. The CS4040 Project

The CS4040 project has a more specific focus than a dissertation.

### CS4040 Project Requirements

* **Primary Focus**: The project **must include an experimental evaluation** of an existing system or algorithm.
* **Goal**: The main goal is to practice research skills: forming testable hypotheses, designing experiments, analyzing results, and writing a report. The focus is **not on coding**.
* **What is NOT Allowed**: Building a new prototype is **not** an acceptable project for CS4040.
* **Relation to Dissertation**: The CS4040 project **must be different from your dissertation**. It cannot be preliminary work for your dissertation, although it is acceptable for it to be in the same general area.

### Typical CS4040 Projects

-   Compare the performance of different recommendation algorithms.
-   Measure the speed impact of caching in a system.
-   Compare the speed of different cryptographic algorithms.
-   Compare the vulnerability of different password schemes to cracking tools.

## 3. LaTeX for Academic Writing

**LaTeX** is a markup language used to create high-quality documents. It is the standard for writing research papers in Computer Science.

* **How it Works**: You write your document in a `.tex` file with markup commands (similar to HTML), which is then compiled into a PDF.
* **Why Use It**: LaTeX provides excellent control over document formatting and has powerful, built-in support for mathematical formulas, bibliographies, tables of contents, and cross-referencing.
* **Recommended Tool**: **Overleaf** is a cloud-based LaTeX editor that is highly recommended. It requires no local setup and is easy to use.
* **CS4040 Requirement**: You must use LaTeX for your CS4040 project report. A template and style files are provided on MyAberdeen.
