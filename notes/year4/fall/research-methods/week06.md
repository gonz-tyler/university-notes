# Week 06: Research Ethics

---

## 1. What is Research Ethics?

Research ethics concerns conducting research in a morally responsible and justifiable way. While ethics applies broadly, this focuses specifically on ethical considerations within the context of research projects.

Historically, unethical research studies (like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the Milgram experiment, and Facebook's emotional manipulation experiment) have caused significant harm, leading to the establishment of strict ethical guidelines and review processes.

### Ethical Approval

Today, most academic research involving human participants requires **formal ethical approval** before the research can begin.

* This applies to student projects (including CS4040 and Honours dissertations).
* **Ethics committees** review research proposals to ensure they meet ethical standards.
* Failure to obtain necessary ethical approval for a project involving human subjects will result in failing the project.

## 2. General Principles of Ethical Research

There are several core principles that guide ethical research conduct:

1.  **Informed Consent**:
    * Participants must understand what the research involves and **voluntarily agree** to take part **before** the experiment begins.
    * Information should be provided clearly and understandably (e.g., via a consent form), not hidden in complex jargon.
    * Consent must be obtained from guardians for participants who cannot consent themselves (e.g., children).
    * While deception is sometimes necessary for certain types of research, it requires strong justification and usually involves debriefing participants afterward. It's best to get informed consent whenever possible.

2.  **No Coercion**:
    * Participants must **not be forced, pressured, or unduly influenced** to participate or remain in a study.
    * They must be explicitly told they are **free to withdraw** at any time without penalty, even if it inconveniences the researcher.

3.  **Protection From Harm**:
    * Research should **minimize any potential risks** to participants. This includes physical harm, psychological stress, emotional distress, or damage to reputation.
    * Researchers must take steps to prevent harm, both to participants and potentially to third parties (e.g., ensuring a medical AI evaluation doesn't lead to incorrect patient treatment).

4.  **Protection of Personal Information (Confidentiality & Anonymity)**:
    * Personal, identifiable information collected during research must be kept confidential and protected according to data protection laws (like GDPR).
    * Published results should use **aggregate statistics** or **anonymized data** to prevent identification of individuals. Be careful even with aggregate data if subgroups are very small (e.g., reporting gender breakdown with only one female participant).

5.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
    * The potential benefits of the research (to knowledge, society, etc.) must outweigh the potential risks or costs (to participants).
    * If any ethical principles (like informed consent or potential for minor harm) are compromised, the researchers must provide a strong justification based on the expected benefits and demonstrate how risks are minimized.

6.  **Honest Reporting of Results**:
    * Researchers must report their findings truthfully and accurately.
    * **Fabricating or falsifying data** is a serious academic offense with severe consequences.
    * Avoid "tweaking" results or analyses simply to make them look better or more statistically significant.

## 3. Research Ethics at the University of Aberdeen

* The university has ethics committees responsible for reviewing research proposals. Computing Science projects fall under the College of Physical Sciences ethics committee (name may change).
* **Procedure**:
    1.  Complete the **ethics checklist** available on the university website.
    2.  If any checklist question is answered "YES," you **must** complete a full **ethical approval form** (Annexes A, B, C, and D or E).
    3.  For undergraduate projects, email the completed forms to Professor Reiter (CS ethics representative). **Do not** use Worktribe or email the central copsethics address.
    4.  Professor Reiter will review the application and either approve it, request changes, or (rarely) reject it.
* **Common Changes Requested**: Improving the consent form/process, providing more detail on subject recruitment, ensuring anonymity in reporting.
* **Timeline**: Approval for straightforward projects is usually quick (aiming for within 1 week for UG projects), but complex cases (e.g., involving deception) can take much longer. Plan accordingly!
* **NHS Ethics**: Research involving NHS patients or staff requires separate, more complex ethical approval directly from the NHS. Avoid this for student projects if possible due to the time and effort involved.
