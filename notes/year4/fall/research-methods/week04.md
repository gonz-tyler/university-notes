# Week04: Academic Writing

## 1. What is Academic Writing?

Academic writing is a formal style of technical writing used to present scientific evidence. It is expected to be serious, factual, and objective.

### Key Characteristics of Academic Style

* **Clarity and Coherence**: The writing must be concise, clear, and easy to follow. Ideas should flow logically with explicit transitions between paragraphs and sections. A good structure to follow is "Point, Evidence, Explain."
* **Formal Tone**:
    * Avoid informal language, jokes, or emojis.
    * Use technical vocabulary appropriate for the field.
    * Generally, avoid using first-person pronouns like "I" or "we."
* **Frugal Language**:
    * Use adjectives and adverbs sparingly. Avoid exaggeration (e.g., "very innovative," "extremely interesting").
    * Do not repeat information. State your point once, clearly.
    * Use hedging words ("suggests," "may," "possibly") only when necessary to reflect uncertainty, not to fill space.
* **Backed-Up Opinions**: You can express opinions, but they must be supported by data, evidence from previous work, and logical arguments.
* **Diagrams and Figures**: Academic papers, especially in CS, are expected to include diagrams, charts, and graphs to present experimental results and illustrate concepts. Keep these simple and easy to understand.

The best way to learn the style is to **read published research papers**.

## 2. The Structure of an Academic Paper

A typical research paper or project report follows a standard structure.

1.  **Abstract**:
    * A very short (100-200 word) summary of the entire paper.
    * It should state the research question, the main contribution, and the key results.
    * Its purpose is to help readers quickly decide if the paper is relevant to them.

2.  **Introduction**:
    * Sets the scene, provides motivation for the research, and summarizes the research question and experiment.
    * Gives the reader a "big picture" overview to help them understand the details that follow.

3.  **Related Work**:
    * Summarizes the most important and relevant previous research.
    * Shows that you are aware of the existing work in the field and clarifies what your work builds upon.

4.  **New Algorithm / System / Method**:
    * Describes the technical contribution of your work.
    * For the CS4040 project, this section would describe the algorithm or system you are evaluating.

5.  **Experimental Design**:
    * Lists the specific, testable **hypotheses**.
    * Describes the experiment in enough detail that another researcher could ideally **replicate** it.

6.  **Results**:
    * Presents the quantitative findings from your experiment, usually in tables or figures.
    * Includes results from statistical tests to show the significance of your findings.
    * Often includes a qualitative **error analysis** to explain why the system performed well or poorly in certain cases.

7.  **Discussion**:
    * Interprets the results. What do they mean? What issues do they raise?
    * This section should be self-contained, as many readers will skip from the Introduction directly to the Discussion.
    * If your results are negative (i.e., your hypothesis was not supported), do not hide this! Discuss it openly.

8.  **Future Work and Conclusion**:
    * **Future Work**: Suggests high-level ideas for follow-up research.
    * **Conclusion**: Summarizes the key findings and insights from your project.

## 3. The Writing Process

Writing a technical report is a multi-stage process.

1.  **Getting Started**: This can be the hardest part. Try creating a detailed outline, using a mind-mapping tool, or just start writing a section you're comfortable with. The introduction, abstract, and conclusion are often written last.
2.  **Drafting**: Write a rough first draft to get all your ideas down.
3.  **Rewriting and Improving**: This is an iterative process. Rewrite and refine your draft multiple times until you are satisfied with the clarity and flow.
4.  **Getting Feedback**: Ask a colleague, supervisor, or friend to read your draft and provide comments. This feedback is incredibly valuable. Give them plenty of time.
5.  **Proofreading**: This is the final step. Use a spell-checker (available in Overleaf) and ask friends to help you catch any remaining spelling and grammar mistakes. A polished report gives a much better impression.

### Using Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT)

* **DO NOT** ask an AI to write your paper for you. The content must come from you.
* **It IS OK** to use AI as a tool for:
    * Brainstorming ideas.
    * Proofreading for spelling and grammar.
    * Improving the style and flow of sentences you have already written.

## 4. The CS4040 Report

The CS4040 report follows the standard academic structure but with one unique addition.

* **Reflections Section**: In your conclusion, you must include a "Reflections" section. This is not part of a normal research paper. It should discuss:
    * What worked well in your project.
    * What did not work well.
    * What you would do differently if you were to start over again.
