# Week 1.1: Introduction to AI (AIMA Ch 1)
## Notes
---
### **Key Concepts**

1. **Definition of AI**:
    - **Four perspectives**:
        - Thinking humanly (cognitive modeling)
        - Thinking rationally (laws of thought)
        - Acting humanly (Turing Test)
        - Acting rationally (rational agent approach)
2. **Foundations of AI**:
    - **Philosophy**: Logic, reasoning, mind-body dualism.
    - **Mathematics**: Probability, statistics, and optimization.
    - **Psychology and Neuroscience**: Understanding human cognition and behavior.
    - **Computer Science**: Algorithms and computational efficiency.
    - **Linguistics**: Natural language processing and representation of knowledge.
3. **Applications of AI**:
    - Robotics, expert systems, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and game playing.
4. **History of AI**:
    - **1950s-70s**: Early optimism, symbolic AI (logic-based systems).
    - **1980s**: Knowledge-based systems, expert systems boom.
    - **1990s**: Rise of machine learning and probabilistic models.
    - **2000s-present**: Deep learning, large-scale data applications, reinforcement learning.
5. **The Turing Test and Rationality**:
    - Turing Test: Evaluates if a machine can exhibit human-like intelligence.
    - Rationality: Making decisions to maximize expected outcomes.
6. **The Scope of AI**:
    - Strong AI (general intelligence) vs. Weak AI (specific tasks).
    - Narrow AI (current systems) vs. General AI (future goal).

### **Challenges in AI**:

- Computational complexity.
- Uncertainty in real-world applications.
- Ethical considerations (bias, accountability, safety).
- Defining intelligence in machines.
