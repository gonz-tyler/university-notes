# Week 1: Lecture 2 Agents

## Notes

---

### Ubiquity

- Continuous reduction of cost of computing
- processing power in contexts/devices which once were uneconomic
- processing capability increases and spreads
- sophistication and “intelligence” become ubiquitous (everywhere)

### Interconnection

- computer systems no longer stand-alone
- systems-of-systems networked as very large distributed systems
- distributed and concurrent systems have become the norm
    - researchers and practitioners developing (theoretical) models of computing as interaction among many distributed systems

### Intelligence

- complexity of tasks automated and delegated has grown

### Delegation

- computers are more autonomous
- computers have control even in safety critical tasks

### Human-Orientation

- computing moving away from machine oriented views of programming
- heading towards the way humans understand the world
- programmers conceptualise and implement software in higher level abstractions

### Programming Progression

- machine code → assembly → machine independent → abstract data types → objects → …agents

### Agent

- an agent is a computer system that is capable of independent action on behalf of its user or owner (figuring out what needs to be done to satisfy design objectives, rather than constantly being told), exhibiting control over their internal state

### Multiagent Systems

- multiagent system consists of number of agents which interact with one another
- agents act on behalf of users with different goals and motivations
- require ability to cooperate, coordinate, and negotiate with each other

### Agent Design

- designing agents capable of independent autonomous action to successfully carry out delegated tasks

### Society Design

- designing agents capable of interacting (cooperating, coordinating, negotiating) with other agents in order to successfully carry out delegated tasks, especially when other agents cannot be assumed to share same interests/goals

### Intelligent Agents

- computer system capable of flexible autonomous action in some environment
- 3 types of behaviours
    - reactive
        - if program environment is guaranteed to be fixed program can just execute blindly (e.g. compiler)
        - most environments are dynamic (real world)
        - reactive system is one that maintains ongoing interaction with its environment and responds to changes that occur in time for response to be useful i.e. real time
    - proactive
        - generally want agents to do things for us
        - goal-directed behaviour
        - proactiveness
            - generating and attempting to achieve goals
            - not driven solely by events
            - taking initiative
            - recognising opportunities
    - social
