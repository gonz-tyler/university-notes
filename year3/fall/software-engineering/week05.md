# Week 5: Gathering Requirements
## Notes
---

### Gathering Requirements
- We want to avoid mistakes when capuring requirements such as
  - wasted effort - too much detail that does not matter
  - obsolescence - development changes from documentation
  - lack of efficacy
  - overly constrained design
  - too much implementation decided too early
  
### Identifying Needs
- scenarios are a narrative that describe how a user might use the system
- simply a description of a situation where a user uses features to do something they want to do
- user stories offer tasks and goals
- user stories follow a template
  - `As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>`
- user stories share some criteria
  - testable
  - valuable to client
  - sized to fit an iteration
  - independent of each other
  - understandable to the client
- scenarios can be used to develop features
  - use scenario to create sotries
  - group stories to form features
  - plan feature development across sprints
  
#### Feature Creep
- feature creep - new features added without considering whether or not these features are generally useful or whether they can be implemented in some way
  - uses budget of money time and people
- feature creep occurs when
  - product manager reluctant to say no when users ask for specific features
  - developers try to math features to competing products
  - product includes features to support both inexperienced and experienced users

### User Stories
- stories form the backlog
- product backlog (all possible features as stories) -> sprint backlog (prioritized iteration stories) -> sprint -> working increment of software
- stories need to be estimated to size for iterations
  - the goal is to make a story fit into a sprint so that it can be prioritized accordingly
- stories breakdown into tasks during iteration
- atories should be grouped by activity

### Iterative and Incremental Development
- incrementally - developing per section (painting one corner of painting completely then moving onto next)
- iteratively - developing per stage (sketching painting then color blocking then next steps...)
- developing incrementally and iteratively together is ideal
