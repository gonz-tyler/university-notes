# Week 2: Applying Agile Approaches

## Notes 

---

### Agile Development
- Agile is incremental and iterative development
- Agile relies upon self-organizing teams
  - teams do all the work together: planning, estimating, etc.
  -scrum master or agile coach will guide team in the practices and perform some management tasks
  team organizes its own tasks
  
### Agile Basics
- Building the app
  - work in small batches to incrementally build functional slices of the application
  - integrate your work frequently
- Validating the app
  - use automated testing to validate your work
  - work closely with those who can provide most useful feedback
  
### Agile Development Overview

- Agile Development is a set of principles and values that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity. It is an umbrella term that covers several methodologies, including Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), and others.
- Key Features of Agile Development:
  - Iterative and Incremental Process: Development is done in small, manageable chunks called iterations or sprints (usually 1-4 weeks), and each iteration produces a potentially shippable product increment.
  - Customer Collaboration: Continuous feedback from the customer is crucial. The focus is on delivering customer value and responding to changes rather than following rigid plans.
  - Adaptation and Flexibility: Teams adjust priorities and goals based on feedback, allowing flexibility in the face of changing requirements.
  - Cross-functional Teams: Teams are typically composed of developers, testers, and business stakeholders, working collaboratively.
  - Simplicity: Focus on the most important features and tasks that bring value to the customer.

### Scrum Methodology Overview

- Scrum is one of the most widely used frameworks under the Agile umbrella. It provides a structured, yet flexible, process for managing software development projects.
- Key Features of Scrum:
  - Roles:
    - Product Owner: Defines the product backlog and prioritizes features.
    - Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process, ensuring the team follows Scrum practices.
    - Development Team: A cross-functional group of developers working to complete the work during sprints.

  - Artifacts:
    - Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features or tasks required for the product.
    - Sprint Backlog: A subset of tasks from the product backlog, planned for the current sprint.
    - Increment: The completed portion of the product at the end of each sprint, which is ready for release or review.

  - Ceremonies:
    - Sprint Planning: The team decides what will be built in the next sprint.
    - Daily Standups: A short, daily meeting where team members report on progress, challenges, and plans.
    - Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the team presents the increment to stakeholders for feedback.
    - Sprint Retrospective: The team reflects on the sprint, discussing what went well and what could be improved.

  - Timeboxes: Scrum works in fixed-length iterations (sprints), typically lasting 2-4 weeks, ensuring a regular release cycle.

### Extreme Programming (XP) Overview
- Extreme Programming (XP) is another Agile methodology that focuses on technical excellence and customer satisfaction through continuous communication and iterative releases.
- Key Features of Extreme Programming (XP):
  - Customer Involvement: XP emphasizes close collaboration with customers, with them actively involved throughout the process.
  - Continuous Feedback: Feedback is gathered frequently (often at the end of each iteration) to ensure the software is meeting customer needs.
  - Frequent Releases: XP encourages delivering small, frequent releases of software to gather feedback quickly.
  - Simplicity: Developers are encouraged to build the simplest solution that works to meet current requirements.
  - Pair Programming: Two developers work together on the same task at the same workstation, promoting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and code quality.
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before writing the code ensures that the software meets the required behavior and quality.
  - Continuous Integration: Code is integrated into the main branch frequently, ideally several times a day, to catch issues early.

### Key Differences Between Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP)
| **Aspect**                     | **Scrum**                                   | **Extreme Programming (XP)**                  |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                       | Managing the process of product development | Technical practices and quality of code       |
| **Iterations/Sprints**          | Fixed-length sprints (typically 1-4 weeks)  | Iterations, typically shorter (1-2 weeks)     |
| **Roles**                       | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team       | Customer, Developer, Coach                    |
| **Customer Involvement**        | Regular reviews, but less frequent          | Continuous, close collaboration with the customer |
| **Team Collaboration**          | Emphasizes team collaboration within roles  | Highly collaborative with practices like pair programming |
| **Key Practices**               | Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Retrospectives | Pair Programming, Test-Driven Development, Continuous Integration |
| **Primary Focus**               | Framework for managing work flow            | Focus on engineering practices and quality    |
| **Adaptability**                | Adapts to change through prioritization and feedback | Focuses on adapting development practices to meet customer needs |
| **Documentation**               | Minimal documentation, focusing on working software | Very minimal documentation, focuses on clean code and automated tests |


### Summary of Key Points
- Agile Development is the umbrella term for a set of methodologies focused on flexibility, customer feedback, and iterative progress. Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) are specific Agile methodologies.

- Scrum is focused on project management and organizing work into sprints, with defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team) and ceremonies (e.g., Sprint Planning, Standups, Reviews, and Retrospectives).

- Extreme Programming (XP) focuses more on the technical aspects of development, encouraging practices like pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), and continuous integration to ensure code quality and customer satisfaction.

- While Scrum manages the development process and roles, XP emphasizes the technical practices to achieve a high standard of software craftsmanship.
